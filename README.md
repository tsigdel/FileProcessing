Architecture Overview:

I have followed a modular and extensible architecture, utilizing interfaces and dependency injection to achieve separation of concerns and maintainability.

1.      Interfaces:

·        The application defines and adheres to the IFileProcessor and IWordProcessor interfaces, promoting abstraction and allowing for the easy substitution of implementations.

2.      Dependency Injection:

·        Constructor injection is employed in the FileProcessor class, where instances of the ILogger and IWordProcessor are injected during initialization.

·        This promotes flexibility, as different implementations of these dependencies can be injected, facilitating unit testing and modularity.

3.      Logging:

·        Logging is integrated using the Serilog library, providing a structured and configurable logging framework.

·        Log messages are categorized based on severity (Information, Error, Debug) and include contextual information to aid in debugging and monitoring.

4.      Asynchronous Programming:

·        Asynchronous programming is employed using the async and await keywords, enhancing the application's responsiveness by allowing non-blocking I/O operations.

·        Methods such as ProcessFileAsync and ExtractFileWordsAsync use asynchronous programming to efficiently handle file processing.

Methods and Techniques:

1.      File Processing:

·        The ProcessFileAsync method asynchronously processes a text file, extracting words and calculating word frequencies using an injected IWordProcessor implementation.

·        Word extraction is delegated to the ExtractFileWordsAsync method, which reads the file asynchronously and uses regular expressions to split the text into words.

2.      Word Processing:

·        Word processing is encapsulated in an implementation of the IWordProcessor interface, named WordProcessor.

·        The ProcessWords method utilizes parallel processing (AsParallel()) to efficiently calculate word frequencies and store them in a ConcurrentDictionary.

3.      Exception Handling:

·        Exception handling is implemented consistently throughout the application.

·        Exceptions are logged with appropriate context information, and the original exception is rethrown to ensure that higher-level components can handle and react to errors appropriately.

4.      Output File Writing:

·        The WriteOutputFile method writes word frequencies to an output file, sorting them first by frequency in descending order and then alphabetically.

5.      Input File Validation:

·        Input file validation is performed in the ValidateInputFile method, ensuring that the file exists and has a valid name.

6.      Output File Validation:

·        Output file validation in the ValidateOutputFile method checks the validity of the output file name, the existence of the output directory, and the write permissions for the output file.
